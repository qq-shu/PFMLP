# PFMLP
**Paillier Federated Multi Layer Perceptron**

This project is a realization of the federated learning based on the paillier algorithm. The selected network is MLP, and the data set is the handwritten digit data set [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and the metal fatigue strength dataset from NIMS.
This project is modified based on the library functions of python [sklearn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git), adding communication and encryption modules to realize the functions of privacy protection and data interaction.
